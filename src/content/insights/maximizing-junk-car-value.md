That old car sitting in your driveway is worth more than you might think. Whether it runs or not, here's how to maximize your payout when selling to a scrap yard.

## Know Your Car's Worth

Junk car values depend on several factors:

- **Weight:** Heavier vehicles contain more scrap metal
- **Condition:** Running cars are worth more than non-running
- **Completeness:** All parts present vs. stripped
- **Make/Model:** Some parts are in higher demand
- **Current scrap prices:** Steel and aluminum markets fluctuate

## Before You Sell: A Checklist

### 1. Remove Personal Belongings

Check the glove box, under seats, and trunk. You'd be surprised what people forget.

### 2. Gather Your Paperwork

You'll need the title to sell your vehicle. If you've lost it, contact the Michigan Secretary of State for a replacement—it's worth the $15 fee.

### 3. Consider Selling Parts Separately

If you have time and mechanical knowledge, selling valuable parts individually can net more money. High-value parts include:

- Catalytic converters (with proper documentation)
- Alternators and starters
- GPS and entertainment systems
- Alloy wheels
- Batteries

### 4. Drain Fluids (Optional)

Some yards pay more for cars with fluids already drained. Check with us first—we handle fluid disposal either way.
