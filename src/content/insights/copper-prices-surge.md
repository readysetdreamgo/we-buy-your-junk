The electric vehicle revolution is reshaping the scrap metal industry, and copper is at the center of it all. With prices hitting multi-year highs, now is the time to understand what's driving the market and how you can capitalize on it.

## Why Copper Prices Are Rising

Electric vehicles require significantly more copper than traditional combustion engines—up to four times as much. As automakers ramp up EV production to meet 2030 emissions targets, demand for copper has skyrocketed.

Add to this the global push for renewable energy infrastructure, which also relies heavily on copper for wiring and components, and you have a perfect storm for price increases.

## How to Maximize Your Returns

If you're sitting on copper scrap, here are some tips to get the best price:

### 1. Clean Your Copper

The cleaner your copper, the higher the grade. Remove any insulation, solder, or attachments. #1 Bare Bright commands the highest prices and should be free of any coatings or oxidation.

### 2. Sort by Grade

Don't mix your copper grades. Keep #1 and #2 copper separate. Mixed loads get priced at the lowest grade present.

### 3. Time Your Sale

Copper prices fluctuate daily based on the COMEX market. We update our prices every morning. If you have flexibility, watch for price spikes—they often occur mid-week.

### 4. Bring Volume

Larger loads often qualify for premium pricing. If you're a contractor or doing a big cleanout, call ahead and we can discuss volume rates.

## Looking Ahead

Industry analysts expect copper demand to continue rising through 2030 as the EV transition accelerates. While short-term volatility is always possible, the long-term trend favors sellers.
