Every week, dozens of Jackson County residents bring their scrap to our yard. Behind each load is a story. Here are three of our favorite recycling heroes.

## Dave the Demolition Contractor

Dave Martinez has been in the demolition business for 25 years. His crew tears down old buildings across mid-Michigan, and recycling is central to his operation.

"We separate everything on site," Dave explains. "Steel beams, copper wiring, aluminum siding—it all has value. What used to go to the landfill now goes to We Buy Your Junk."

Last year, Dave's company recycled over 200 tons of metal, diverting it from landfills and putting money back into his business.

## The Peterson Farm

The Peterson family has farmed the same land in Grass Lake for four generations. When old equipment breaks down, they don't let it rust in the field.

"My grandfather would fix everything until it couldn't be fixed anymore," says Tom Peterson. "Now when something's truly done, we scrap it properly. It's the responsible thing to do."

The Petersons bring in old tractors, implements, and fencing several times a year. The money helps offset the cost of new equipment.

## Maria's Side Hustle

Maria Gonzalez started scrapping as a way to earn extra money while her kids were in school. What began as collecting cans has grown into a profitable side business.

"I drive around on trash day and pick up what people throw out," Maria says. "Old grills, lawn mowers, appliances—people throw away so much metal. I clean it up, sort it, and bring it here."

Maria now earns $500-800 per month from scrapping, all while keeping recyclable materials out of the waste stream.
