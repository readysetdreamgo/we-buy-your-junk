Steel prices have been volatile this quarter, with construction slowdowns and global trade dynamics creating uncertainty. Here's what scrappers should expect this winter.

## Current Market Conditions

Steel scrap prices have softened 10-15% from summer highs. Several factors are at play:

- **Seasonal slowdown:** Construction activity typically decreases in winter months
- **Global oversupply:** Chinese steel production remains high despite weak domestic demand
- **Interest rates:** Higher borrowing costs have slowed new construction projects

## What We're Paying

Current rates at We Buy Your Junk (as of October 2025):

- **Heavy Melting Steel:** $180 - $200/ton
- **Light Iron/Sheet Metal:** $140 - $160/ton
- **Cast Iron:** $160 - $180/ton
- **Automobiles (complete):** $200 - $250/ton

## Our Forecast

We expect prices to remain stable through December, with potential upside in Q1 2026 as construction resumes. Key factors to watch:

### Infrastructure Spending

Federal infrastructure projects are ramping up, which should increase steel demand by spring. Michigan has several bridge and highway projects scheduled.

### Automotive Production

Detroit automakers are maintaining production levels, providing steady demand for steel scrap in the region.

### Export Markets

Turkey and other major scrap importers are showing renewed interest, which could support prices.

> "Winter is typically a slower season, but we're optimistic about 2026. Hold your steel if you can, or sell now if you need the cash—prices are still fair."
