One of the most common mistakes new scrappers make is bringing in mixed loads. Proper sorting can increase your payout by 20-40%. Here's everything you need to know about separating metals.

## The Magnet Test

The simplest way to start sorting is with a magnet. This separates ferrous (iron-containing) metals from non-ferrous metals.

- **Magnetic (Ferrous):** Steel, iron, cast iron
- **Non-Magnetic (Non-Ferrous):** Copper, aluminum, brass, stainless steel, lead

Non-ferrous metals are generally worth more, so this is your first sorting priority.

## Identifying Common Metals

### Copper

Copper has a distinctive reddish-orange color. It's soft and conducts electricity well. You'll find it in electrical wiring, plumbing pipes, and HVAC components.

### Brass

Brass is a copper-zinc alloy with a yellowish color. Common sources include plumbing fixtures, door hardware, and musical instruments. It's heavier than aluminum but lighter than copper.

### Aluminum

Aluminum is lightweight and silvery. It's non-magnetic and often found in cans, siding, window frames, and automotive parts. Cast aluminum (like engine blocks) is worth less than sheet aluminum.

### Stainless Steel

Stainless steel is silvery and non-magnetic (mostly). It's heavier than aluminum and often found in appliances, sinks, and cookware. Look for the "18/8" or "304" markings.

## Pro Tips for Better Sorting

1. Set up separate bins for each metal type
2. Remove attachments and fasteners when possible
3. Keep clean and dirty metals separate
4. Learn to identify alloys—they're often worth more
