Michigan's Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) has released updated guidelines for scrap metal recycling operations effective January 1, 2026. Here's what sellers and buyers need to know.

## Key Changes

### Enhanced ID Requirements

All scrap metal transactions over $25 now require a valid government-issued photo ID. This is an increase from the previous $50 threshold. We'll scan and store ID information as required by law.

### Catalytic Converter Documentation

Selling catalytic converters now requires additional documentation proving ownership. This includes vehicle registration or a bill of sale from a licensed auto dealer or repair shop.

### Payment Delays

Certain high-theft items (catalytic converters, copper wire over 10 lbs) now have a mandatory 3-day payment hold for first-time sellers. Regular customers with established accounts are exempt.

## What This Means for You

For most scrappers, these changes are minor inconveniences designed to reduce metal theft. Here's how to prepare:

- Always bring valid ID when selling
- Keep receipts and documentation for valuable items
- Establish a regular account with us to avoid payment delays

## Our Commitment

We Buy Your Junk has always operated with full compliance to state and federal regulations. These new rules align with our existing practices, and we're here to help you navigate any changes.
